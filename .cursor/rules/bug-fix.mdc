# Bug Fix Workflow

1. 🛠 Receive Bug Information

    - Require the user to provide:
        - Expected behavior vs. actual behavior
        - Clear reproduction steps
    - If the information is missing or vague, stop and ask for clarification.

2. 🔍 Analyze Code and Insert Logs

    - Identify relevant modules/components
    - Trace key state changes and event flows
    - Add temporary logs to narrow down the problem area

3. 🔁 Ask the user to reproduce the issue and provide logs

4. 🧩 Fix the root cause with minimal code changes

    - Focus on fixing the **underlying cause**, not just the symptoms
    - Make the **smallest possible change**
    - **Avoid side effects** to unrelated features
    - **Keep TypeScript error-free** (type safety is mandatory)

5. 🔨 Build the project and fix any errors

6. 🧪 Ask the user to test the fix and wait

    - Provide regression test cases if needed

7. ✅ If the issue is resolved, remove all debugging logs

8. And commit the fix:

```
fix: F00 [한국어로 문제 내용 요약] 문제 수정
```

9. 📝 Update documentation:

    - `todo.md`: Update task status
    - `log.md`: Document cause and solution clearly in log.md by **appending to the end of the file**

10. 🗃 Commit documentation update:

```
docs: F00 [한국어로 문제 내용 요약] 문제 수정 기록
```
