1.	Interpreting the input file
	•	The file todo.md reflects the current task status:
        •	Completed tasks
        •	Tasks in progress
        •	Upcoming tasks
	•	Use this file and the codebase to prepare for the task.
2.	Before writing any code
	•	If the task is unclear or the specification seems insufficient, ask the user for clarification.
	•	Do not start any work until you receive a clear and complete response.
3.	Conditions for writing or modifying code
	•	Only begin coding or making changes when the user gives an explicit instruction such as “fix this,” “modify this,” or “proceed.”
	•	After completing the code, build the project and check for errors.
4.	Writing test cases
	•	After completing the code, create test cases in the file test-case.md.
	•	Each test case should include:
        •	Preconditions
        •	Execution steps
        •	Expected result
        •	Result (leave this blank)
	•	Write as many test cases as necessary based on the complexity of the task.
	•	The user will manually go through the test cases. If any issues are found, the user will request fixes in batches of 1 to 5 test cases.
5.	After all test cases pass
	•	When all test cases pass, update todo.md as instructed by the user:
        •	Move the in-progress task to the completed section.
        •	Move the next planned task to the top of the upcoming section.
	•	When writing completion notes, include only structural decisions or special considerations essential for understanding the project.
	•	Omit minor bug fixes or incidental details to keep the file short and LLM-efficient.
6.	Recording timestamps
	•	When recording task completion or updating plans, you must include the current timestamp.
	•	Since the LLM may not have access to the current time, use a terminal command like date to check the current time and record it accordingly.
7.	Responding to user questions
	•	If the user asks a question, provide an answer only.
	•	Do not take any action until the user gives a clear instruction to proceed.
