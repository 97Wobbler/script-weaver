1. **No Code Changes Without Explicit Instructions**  
   • If the user asks a question, respond with an answer only.  
   • Do **not** modify or write any code unless the user gives a clear instruction such as “fix,” “change,” or “implement.”

2. **Always Record Timestamps When Logging Work**  
   • When writing entries to `todo.md`, `log.md`, or any related file, always include the current timestamp.  
   • Since the LLM may not know the current time, use a terminal command such as `date` to check the time.  
   • Format the timestamp as: `YYYY/MM/DD HH:mm`.

3. **Summarize Only Critical Information in Logs**  
   • When summarizing work in `todo.md` or `log.md`, focus only on structural decisions and special considerations that are essential for understanding the project.  
   • Omit minor bug fixes or incidental notes to keep the files concise and efficient for LLM processing.
